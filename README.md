## Introduction
This project was developed as part of team programming class, in Applied Informatics degree at the University of Silesia.  

The aim of this project is to enable a single chatbot implementation and deployment to work with multiple chat platforms.  
Write your bot once, and have it talk to humans through any of the supported chats.  

This is achieved by running several normal "bots" *(reffered to as **backends**)* concurrently with multithreading  
and having each backend call your function when it is asked something.
